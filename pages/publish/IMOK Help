<p>HELP</p>
<p>After registering for an account, click on 'Settings' if it does not automatically take you there.</p>
<p>Add up to three email addresses to send alerts to. You must enter at least one.</p>
<p>Modify the default alert message to suit your situation. Add contact numbers, instructions, etc...</p>
<p>Select an 'Alert Date' and an 'Alert Time' that you will be able to 'Check In' by.</p>
<p>Select an 'Alert Interval'. Daily seems reasonable for pet owners.</p>
<p>If you do not push the IMOK button before the 'Alert Time', an alert email will be sent to your email list every hour until you push the IMOK button.</p>
<p>If you push the IMOK button before the 'Alert Date/Time' no alert will be sent to your email list, and a new 'Alert Date/Time' is set according to the 'Alert Interval'.</p>
<p>If you push the IMNOTOK button an email alert is sent immediately to those in your email list.</p>
<p>Example: If you choose an 'Alert Date' of 10 Sept 2021, and an 'Alert Time' of 9 am, and an 'Alert Interval' of one day; when you push the IMOK button your next 'Alert Date/Time' will be set to 9 am the next day.</p>
